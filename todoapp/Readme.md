When the site loads, the user will land on the Log in page and see the input fields as well as a message prompting them to create an account if they don't already have one. Once a user creates an account and logs in, they will be redirected to the ToDo List Page where all of the lists that are created by the user will be displayed. From this page the user will be able to access the add item form to create a new todo item. The user will also be able to view, edit, or delete any of their existing items. Each time a new item is created, a random image will be displayed on the view item page.
